# Crowd Sense
Do you ever feel like you do not understand your audience? Well, with this app made using Swift makes understanding your audience easier!
Just take out your iphone and take a video of the audience by pressing the start button, once you are done recording press the
red button. The different emojis tell you how your audience is feeling and the graph button on the upper right corner will display a graph about how your audience is feeling.

# How-to-install
```
pod install
```

and open `CrowdSense.xcworkspace`
